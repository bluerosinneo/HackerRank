HackerRank Project Euler

First thought is to use prime sieve (Sieve of Eratosthenes)

By knowing that the 10,000th prime is 104729
using a sieve of the first 110,000 we will captuer all primes less than the 10,000th

create the entier sieve and an areay list of primes it finds
before taking into consideration what primes the problem wants

worked like a charm :-)
